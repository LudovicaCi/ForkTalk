# ForkTalk
Project for Large Scale and Multi-Structured Databases course at University of Pisa

ForkTalk is a Java-based web application that allows users to search, rate and book restaurants based on their preferences. The system features a user-friendly interface that enables users to search for restaurants based on parameters such as location, cuisine, rating, and price range. 
Users can create restaurant lists, like them, and follow other users to get recommendations for new restaurants. They can also write reviews for restaurants they have visited and read reviews from other users to help them make informed decisions. 
The system includes a secure user authentication mechanism that ensures that only registered users can access the applicationâ€™s features. 
An administrator account is also available to manage the content of the application, such as removing restaurants,suspend users and restaurant lists. 
Overall, the ForkTalk System provides a convenient and efficient way for users to discover new restaurants, connect with other users, and book reservations with ease.
