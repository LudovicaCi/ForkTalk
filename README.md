# ForkTalk - Project for Large Scale and Multi-Structured Databases Course

This project was developed for the Large Scale and Multi-Structured Databases course at the University of Pisa.

## Overview

ForkTalk is a Java-based web application that enables users to search, rate, and book restaurants based on their preferences. The system features a user-friendly interface allowing users to search for restaurants based on parameters such as location, cuisine, rating, and price range.

Users can create restaurant lists, like them, and follow other users to get recommendations for new restaurants. Additionally, users can write reviews for restaurants they have visited and read reviews from other users to make informed decisions. The system includes a secure user authentication mechanism that ensures only registered users can access the applicationâ€™s features. An administrator account is also available to manage the content of the application, such as removing restaurants, suspending users, and managing restaurant lists.

Overall, the ForkTalk System provides a convenient and efficient way for users to discover new restaurants, connect with other users, and book reservations with ease.
